1.  Take the following pseudo-code and write a C literate program roundoff.w to print out x after every
30 iterations.  This program is to demonstrate what kind of round off error we get after 900 iterations.


x = 1/3;
kntr = 0;
do
kntr = kntr + 1;
x = (9 * x + 1) * x - 1;
while kntr < 900

2.  Use the script cweb.sh to extract C code to compile and execute, and TeX code to compile
and create a PDF of code documentation.

3.  Modify the program to print out x every time through the loop.

4.  Create a Makefile to make the binary, the documentation, and clean up the files in the directory.
