The CWEB program  treeprint.w is a very old C literate program to print out a directory structure to an
ASCII terminal. The Current version  uses man non-ANSI C system and C library calls.  I would like Claude
to generate a treeprint.ch (CWEB change file) to update the system and C library calls in
treeprint.w to the ANSI standard.

Use the script in $HOME/bin/cweb.sh to generate the C file treeprint.c, like this:

    $ cweb.sh ctangle treeprint.w treeprint.ch

Then compile the program like the following:

     $ gcc -std-c89 -o treeprint treeprint.c
